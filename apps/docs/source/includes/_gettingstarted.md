## Getting Started

## Common Component for Payments REST APIs

###  Overview

The Common Component for Payments is an API-driven system designed to streamline and automate the repetitive and manual tasks that ministries face when receiving and sending payments. The system aims to enhance the quality of data and traceability of payment transactions, while reducing the possibility of errors when re-entering data between systems.

The initial use cases for this project have been provided by Service BC to support the modernization of the Government Agent Revenue Management System (GARMS), as well as the Ministry of Labour’s Employment Standards Branch. The project team has also engaged broadly with stakeholders across government to identify opportunities for incremental improvement within government’s existing payments ecosystem.

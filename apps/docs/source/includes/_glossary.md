| API          	| An Application Programming Interface (API) is a software-to-software interface that provides a secure and standardized way for applications to communicate with each other to deliver requested data without user intervention.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               	|
| API Consumer 	| API Consumers (organizations providing services to end-users) use the APIs available through the APS Platform in the delivery of their services. API Consumers integrate the APIs into their applications.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    	|
| API Gateway  	| The API Gateway is a service that facilitates the management and execution of APIs by routing requests. It extends the capabilities of APIs with the use of controls such as authentication, authorization, rate limiting, and IP limitations allowing systems to be safely and efficiently integrated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       	|
| API Key      	| An API Key is a unique identifier (a random series of letters and numbers) used to authenticate an application accessing a specific API. The application includes the Key in each API request, and the API uses the Key to identify the application and authorize the request. The API Key is used in combination with an API Secret.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         	|
| API Secret   	| The API Secret is a software-level credential (password) used to securely authenticate an application or user. The Secret is included in all API requests to identify the Consumer. The API Secret is used in combination with an API Key. The Secret is known only to the Consumer and the API gateway. It is only displayed upon creation and must be recorded by the Consumer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             	|
| API Provider 	| An API Provider, usually a developer, creates, publishes, operates, and maintains APIs in the APS Management Platform.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        	|
| Environment  	| An environment in software development is the collection of stages that an application moves through during development and include development, testing, staging and production.  - The development environment is the workspace for developers to design, program, debug, change, etc. an application or system.  - Test teams use the testing environment to conduct tests and ensure the quality and functionality of the application or system. Testers can identify bugs, errors, or defects and review fixes.  - A staging environment is a replica of a production environment with the purpose of testing code, builds, and updates to ensure quality in a production-like environment before deploying the application or system to the live (production) environment.  - Production is the environment where the application or system is in operation and available to end-users. 	|
